We program several interesting models in Hamiltonian Modeling Language.

## Hamiltonian Modeling Language

The structure of a quantum evolution written in HML is:
1. A quantum system.
2. Sites in quantum systems.
3. Operators of sites.
4. Expressions composed by site operators.

Then an evolution consists of several segments of evolution under time-independent Hamiltonian.

## Several Example Systems

* [Heisenberg model]({{ 'examples/qs/heisenberg/' | relative_url }})
* [Jaynes-Cumming model]({{ 'examples/qs/jaynes-cumming/' | relative_url }})
